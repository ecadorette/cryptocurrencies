# cryptocurrencies
Module19

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use a clustering algorithm to create a classification system for crytocurrencies, this will be used by the client for their new investment portfolio. 

## The Process:
- raw data was preprocessed to prepare the data for PCA
- data was reduced to 3 dimensions using PCA
- cryptocurrencies were clustered using K-means
- visualizations were created for the client to better understand the data

Summary:
The data was successfully clustered into three main groups for the clients to utitlize. I think stock prices or related information could have been added this data for extra depth. The client may be able to use this data to build their portfolio into three different options, but it's unclear if this analysis has provided any other insight.
